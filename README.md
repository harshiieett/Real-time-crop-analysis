Data collection and preprocessing: A sizable dataset of photos of crops with and without illnesses was used. utilised datasets that were openly accessible. Then, to expand the dataset and lessen overfitting, preprocess the photos by resizing, normalising, and augmenting them.

Divide the dataset: Separate the dataset into sets for testing, validation, and training. The model will be trained using the training set, its performance will be tracked during training using the validation set, and its ultimate performance will be assessed using the testing set.

Construct the model: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of many deep learning designs that can be applied to image classification. EfficientNet is a pre-trained model that we can start with and refine using your dataset, or we can start from scratch and create a new model. An image should be fed into the model, which will then produce a probability distribution across the various disease groups.

Get the model trained: Use the training dataset to train the model, then use the validation dataset to track its performance. To get the optimum performance, you might need to try out several architectures and hyperparameters.

Assess the model: Assess the model's effectiveness using the testing dataset. Metrics like recall, accuracy, and precision can be used to gauge the model's performance
